# Light-LOAM
This is the implementation for the Paper ``Light-LOAM: A Lightweight LiDAR Odometry and Mapping based on Graph-Matching''. This code is modified from [A-LOAM](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/A-LOAM).

## Requirements
* PCL
* ROS
* ceres

## Introduction
This is the beta version, and the final implementation code would be published later. The research paper [CoT: Cooperative Training for Generative Modeling of Discrete Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03782) is now available on arXiv. Watch our demo at [Video Link](https://youtu.be/PzZly1SQtng).
