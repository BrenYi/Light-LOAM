# Light-LOAM
News: Our paper has been accepted by the RA-L journal! 
This is the implementation for the Paper ``Light-LOAM: A Lightweight LiDAR Odometry and Mapping based on Graph-Matching''. This code is modified from [A-LOAM](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/A-LOAM).

## Requirements
* PCL 1.10
* ROS
* Ceres 1.14.x

## Introduction
This is the beta version, and the final implementation code is coming soon. The research paper [Light-LOAM: A Lightweight LiDAR Odometry and Mapping based on Graph-Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04162) is now availble on arXiv.
